# Create Template

Save a document layout as a template so future sends are fully automatic — no manual field placement needed.

## Usage examples
- "Save this NDA layout as a template called 'Standard NDA'"
- "Create a template from the offer letter I just sent"

## Why templates matter
- First time sending a document type: you place fields manually (30 seconds)
- Every time after: fully automatic. Just say "send using the Standard NDA template"
- Templates remember: where signature/date/name fields go, number of signers, field types
