4. **Branding Protection Clause:**
   
   Any deployment, distribution, or modification of this software MUST preserve
   and display the "Powered by CoSeal" branding in the user interface. This
   includes, but is not limited to:
   
   - The CoSealBranding component in the signing UI footer
   - Any visible attribution to CoSeal in the signing ceremony interface
   - References to CoSeal in generated documents (e.g., Certificate of Completion)
   
   **The branding may not be:**
   - Removed from the user interface
   - Hidden or obscured through CSS, JavaScript, or other means
   - Modified to remove or replace "CoSeal" with another name or logo
   - Made invisible or unreadable to end users
   
   **White-labeling (removal or replacement of CoSeal branding) is permitted
   ONLY under the following conditions:**
   
   a) For internal use within a single organization (not offered as a service
      to third parties), OR
   
   b) With an explicit enterprise entitlement from the CoSeal project
      maintainers, OR
   
   c) For distributions that do not include the signing UI (API-only deployments)
   
   **Enforcement:**
   - The CoSealBranding component includes runtime integrity checks to detect
     and prevent tampering or removal.
   - Violations of this branding clause constitute a breach of the license terms
     and will result in termination of your rights under this license.
   - The CoSeal project maintainers reserve the right to pursue legal action
     for egregious violations.
   
   **Rationale:**
   This clause ensures that users of documents signed via CoSeal can identify
   the software used and verify its open-source nature. It also protects the
   CoSeal project's reputation by preventing unauthorized white-labeling that
   could introduce security vulnerabilities or confuse users about the software's
   provenance.
